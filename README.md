# InvestoBot
Welcome to my summer 2023 project, InvestoBot! An interactive and intuitive investment tracking system created for amateur investors to visualize and mathematically track their stock market activities.

# Authentication
This project utilizes a user authentication system to allow this system to be used by a large number of users and to keep each user's data secure from the others. Once on the site, users do not have to worry about interfering with data from other users as the appropriate data is retrieved in the back-end. Only a username, password, name, and email are needed to sign up, and the username and password are needed to sign in.

# Buying and Selling Investments
The bulk of the work with this project had to deal with the buying and selling of investments, how to manage this data, and ensuring it is accurate with global stock market data. Users can add an investment by entering a stock ticker (must be a valid NASDAQ code) and selecting the date of investment, as we aren't making an actual investment here, just a tool, so having bought an investment in the past is okay. This purchase is then sent to the database and stored in correspondence with the user, and the effects of this purchase are reflected on the site in the user's assets and wallet. Assets tracks the combined value of the user's active investments, while the wallet tracks the liquid cash that the user has.
